(* Imperative pairing heap implementation of priority queues, supporting decreaseKey hence
   making it suitable for use in a number of important algorithms.  If this operation isn't
   needed one of the non-imperative implementations may be faster and preferable.

   In practice this data structure tends to be faster than alternatives like Fibonacci heaps
   in basically every situation where decreaseKey is required.  *)
